The basic idea is to sync directory listing for both A as well as B
Consideration is both server_a and server_b are running on different machines. 
But for simplicity coded in such a way that you need to run all code on same machine.
Involves client-server socket connection.

- Run server_b.py
- Run server_a.py
  This should make connection with server_b which was already running.
-run lab_1.py
